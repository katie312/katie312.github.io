She is currently pursuing her undergraduate degree at the School of Computer Science, Sichuan University (SCU), expected to graduate in 2025. Previously, she received guidance from Professor Xuedong Yuan and Professor Weihua Zhang at Sichuan University. She is now interning at the West China-SenseTimeJoint Lab, focusing on research related to diffusion generative models.

Her research interests are concentrated within the realm of computer vision, with a primary focus on Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), multimodal learning, large-scale vision models, and diffusion-based generative models. Her objective is to enhance the practicality of AI-generated contexts in real-world applications by investigating optimal strategies for effectively leveraging imperfect data.
