She is currently pursuing her MPhil degree at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou campus, expected to graduate in 2027. Previously, she graduated from Sichuan University and conducted research under Prof. Kang Li at Huaxi & SenseTime Lab. She is now a researcher at the HKUST(GZ) NLP Lab under the guidance of Xuming Hu, focusing on multimodal retrieval, panoramic spatial reasoning, and omni-directional scene understanding.

Her research interests center on computer vision and multimodal learning, with a particular focus on large-scale vision models, multi-view spatial reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation. She aims to improve the practicality of AI-generated contexts in real-world applications by exploring strategies for effectively leveraging imperfect and heterogeneous data.
